# List of resources for local communities during the Coronavirus pandemic

The idea here is if you know of a resource that might be helpful to during the coronavirus pandemic, you can easily share it here, and then share this resource.

Examples: a local community slack, virtual conferences or concerts, food/medicine resources for those in need, important information about local government regulations.
